# CSE310_module05_C-

# Overview

I am learning / playing around with C++. The goal was to create a very basic airline reservation module using different kinds of techniques and concepts. 

With this program, the user is able to open a txt file that has the list of available flights. They can also get the total for how much the tickets would cost depending on how many a customer wants to buy. The program also allows a user to see a flight manifest for each flight. The user then can add a person to the manifest which is stored in a seperate txt file. 

My purpose for writing this was to first become more familiar with the basics of c++ and to practice writing code that can open and write to a txt file.

# Development Environment

To write this software I used Visual Studio Community 2022

The libraries I used from c++ were: iostream, fstream, cstdio, string, stdlib.h, stdio.h

# Future Work

* Make the program a little more user friendly with more options like to delete people from manifest.
* Add a more autmatic approach to looking up flights or manifests instead of having to type in the txt file name.
* simplify the code using more classes to organize the functions.
